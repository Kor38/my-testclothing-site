  <h1>About Korey</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>From Doodles to Design</h2>
    <p>My name is Korey, and I’ve been drawing ever since I could hold a pencil. What started as simple sketches on the backs of homework pages eventually turned into full-blown illustrations and personal designs. I didn’t always know I’d pursue clothing — but I always knew I wanted to create.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why T-Shirts?</h2>
    <p>Out of all the canvases in the world, there’s something raw and real about a blank t-shirt. It’s simple, personal, and mobile. Your shirt becomes your identity, and I wanted to be part of that story — to give people art they can wear. That’s what pushed me to start Custom Shop: my own space to bring designs to life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Design with Purpose</h2>
    <p>Every design I make is hand-drawn and digitally refined. I don’t use templates or stock images. My goal is to offer something personal, expressive, and a little bit bold. Whether it's minimalist line art or layered color explosions, I want the art to speak for itself — and for the wearer.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Just Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Right now, it’s just me — drawing, printing, testing fabrics, and packing up orders. But that’s how I want it. I want every product to feel like it came from a real person, not a factory. I hope this shop grows with me as I keep learning and experimenting. This is only the beginning of what I want to build.</p>
  </div>
